# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

The purpose of this project is to aggregate data from different schools in order to help the school board make informed decisions regarding budgeting and priorities. Standardized test results from 15 different schools were analyzed along with budgets in order to detect trends and rank overall performance.

## Results

The District Summary remains unchanged from the modification of 9th graders' scores. 

The School Summary shows a drop in "passing math," "passing reading," and "overall passing" percentages. 

By replacing the 9th grade reading and math scores at Thomas High School, the overall passing percentage drops from 90% to 65%.

By replacing the 9th grade scores: 
Math and reading scores for 9th graders were replaced with "NaN"

It is shown that school spending in the range of $630-644 per student correlates to decreased "passing math," "passing reading," and "overall passing" percentage.

The medium schools show a drop in "passing math," "passing reading," and "overall passing" percentage after updating the summary. 

The "overall passing percentage" for charter schools drop from 90% to 87% after the update.

## Summary

After modifying the 9th grade scores, Thomas High School's performance decreases. As Thomas High School is also a charter school, its decreased performance leads to a decrease in charter schools' overall passing percentage as well. However, charter schools still outperform district schools, with the 5 top schools all being charters and the bottom 5 schools all being district.
